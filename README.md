# Portfolio V2

This is the second edition of my portfolio. I've tried to reproduce and improve the first edition with Angular and TypeScript instead of JavaScript. Exit PHP, I used services to make my form functional. This time, Bootstrap was used on large part of the app.

My goal was to adapt the first edition and add some useful components.

Enjoy !
